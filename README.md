1) Find Maximum Out Of 2 Numbers
This program allows the user to input two numbers and compares them to find out which one is greater. If the first number is greater than the second, it will print that the first number is greater. Otherwise, it will print that the second number is greater. If the two numbers are equal, we can include a message that indicates they are the same.

2) Find Minimum Out Of 2 Numbers
Similar to the previous program, this one takes two numbers as input and compares them to determine which one is smaller. If the first number is smaller than the second, it will print that the first number is smaller. If the second number is smaller, it will print that the second number is smaller. If both numbers are equal, we can print a message saying so.

3) Find Leap Year From Given Year
This program checks whether a given year is a leap year. A leap year occurs every 4 years, except for years divisible by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year, but 1900 is not. If the year is divisible by 4, and either not divisible by 100 or divisible by 400, the program will print that it's a leap year. Otherwise, it will print that it's not a leap year.

4) Find Odd/Even Number
In this program, the user enters a number, and the program checks whether the number is odd or even. An even number is divisible by 2 with no remainder, while an odd number will have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. The program will print whether the entered number is odd or even.

5) Find Positive/Negative Number
This program determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero. If the number is greater than zero, it's positive, and if it's less than zero, it's negative. If the number is zero, the program will print that it's neither positive nor negative. The program handles all three possibilities.

6) Find Maximum Among 3 Numbers
This program allows the user to input three numbers and finds the greatest of the three. Using conditional statements, the program compares all three numbers and prints the largest one. If the numbers are equal, the program can print a message indicating that all the numbers are the same.

7) Find Interest Rate Based On Given Age
In this program, the user inputs their age and bank balance, and the program determines the interest rate based on those inputs. If the user is over 60 years old and has more than 50,000 in their bank balance, they get a higher interest rate. If the user is 60 or older but has a lower balance, they get a moderate interest rate. For anyone younger than 60, they receive a lower interest rate. This program gives different interest rates based on age and balance.

8) Find If Student Is Pass Or Fail
This program helps determine if a student passes or fails based on their marks. It takes the studentâ€™s marks as input and checks which grade or category they fall into. If the marks are higher than 80, the input is considered invalid. If the marks are within valid range (0-100), it then checks the grade category, ranging from distinction for marks above 70, first class for marks between 60-69, second class for marks between 45-59, and pass for marks between 35-44. If the marks are below 35, the student fails.
